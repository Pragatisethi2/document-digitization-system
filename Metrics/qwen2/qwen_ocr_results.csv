R&D QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

SUGGESTION/SOLUTION FORM

Name/Phone Ext.: M. Hamann, P. Harper, P. Martinez Date: 9/3/92

Supervisor/Manager: J. S. Wigand R&D Group: Licensee

Suggestion: Discontinue coal retention analyses on licensee submitted product samples. (Note: Coal Retention testing is not performed by most licensees. Other B&W physical measurements as ends stability and inspection for soft spots in cigarettes are thought to be sufficient measures to assure cigarette physical integrity. The proposed action will increase laboratory productivity.)

Suggested Solution(s): Delete coal retention from the list of standard analyses performed on licensee submitted product samples. Special requests for coal retention testing could still be submitted on an exception basis.

Have you contacted your Manager/Supervisor? Yes No

Manager Comments: Manager, please contact suggester and forward comments to the Quality Council.

SUGGESTION: (Describe Current Situation and Idea)

The current system of managing records is too complex. The trend seems to be increasingly
specific, when we should be getting more general. Right now, people must work to understand
the system. We must spend too much time administering the system, labeling, and cleaning
our files. Complying is a real burden, both for the individual and for the records
coordinators.

Describe Possible Solutions and Benefits:

1. Drop the category specifications altogether.

2. Use more general categories.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Cigarette Test Station (CTS400) combines many of the stand-alone instruments that
R&D currently uses to measure cigarette weight, pressure drop, ventilation, and
hardness into one compact module. The CTS400 has the additional measurement of
cigarette hardness in comparison with the CTS300. With this added measurement R&D will
be able to replace the Firmness Integrator that measures cigarette firmness in addition
to other measurements that are mentioned above. The Firmness Integrator is no longer
manufactured and parts are becoming difficult to obtain. Lastly, purchase of this
instrument would provide similar capability as the Macon Plant and help facilitate
comparisons between laboratories.
